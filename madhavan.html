            <p class="card-text pt-1 pb-1 text-light "> Ranganathan Madhavan, widely known as R. Madhavan, is a
              multifaceted Indian figure excelling as an actor,
              writer, director, and producer, primarily active in Tamil and Hindi cinema. Throughout his illustrious
              career, he has garnered numerous accolades, including a
              National Film Award, four Filmfare Awards South, and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award. Currently, he holds
              the position of President at the Film and Television Institute
              of India (FTII) in Pune. Madhavan first gained prominence in Tamil cinema with his role in Mani Ratnam's
              romantic drama film "Alai Payuthey" (2000), establishing himself
              as a romantic hero through noteworthy performances in high-grossing films like Gautham Vasudev Menon's
              "Minnale" and Madras Talkies' "Dumm Dumm Dumm" in 2001. His
              career continued to ascend with critical and commercial successes in films such as "Kannathil Muthamittal"
              (2002), "Run" (2002), "Jay Jay" (2003), and "Aethirree" (2004).
              Concurrently, he ventured into Hindi cinema, contributing to hits like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra's "Rang De
              Basanti" (2006), Mani Ratnam's "Guru" (2007), and Rajkumar
              Hirani's "3 Idiots" (2009), the latter becoming the highest-grossing Indian film at the time of its
              release. Amidst box office triumphs like "Tanu Weds Manu" (2011) and
              "Vettai" (2012), Madhavan took a hiatus before returning in 2015 with successful films like the romantic
              comedy-drama "Tanu Weds Manu Returns," the bilingual sports
              drama "Irudhi Suttru" (2016), and the crime film "Vikram Vedha" (2017). His portrayal of a boxing coach in
              "Irudhi Suttru" earned him Best Actor awards at the Filmfare,
              IIFA, and SIIMA ceremonies. </p>
