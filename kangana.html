            <p class="card-text pt-1 pb-1 text-light"> Kangna Amardeep Ranaut, a prominent figure in Hindi cinema, is
              celebrated for her compelling portrayals of strong women in
              female-centric films. Her performances have earned her four National Film Awards, five Filmfare Awards,
              and spots in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list six times. In 2020, the Government
              of India honored her with the Padma Shri for her contributions to Indian cinema.

              Ranaut's journey began at sixteen with modeling before training under theatre director Arvind Gaur. Her
              film debut in the 2006 thriller "Gangster" earned her the Filmfare Award for
              Best Female Debut. Subsequent emotionally intense roles in films like "Woh Lamhe..." (2006), "Life in a...
              Metro" (2007), and "Fashion" (2008) brought critical acclaim, with the latter
              earning her the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress.

              Despite facing criticism for being typecast, Ranaut defied expectations with a well-received comic role in
              "Tanu Weds Manu" (2011). She continued her success with "Krrish 3" (2013),
              one of the highest-grossing Indian films. Consecutive National Film Awards for Best Actress for "Queen"
              (2014) and "Tanu Weds Manu Returns" (2015) followed.

              In 2019, her co-directed venture, "Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi," was a success. In 2020, she entered
              production with her company, Manikarnika Films, showcasing her talents as
              a director and producer. Known for her outspoken nature and alignment with right-wing ideologies, Ranaut's
              bold opinions and frequent clashes contribute to her reputation as a multifaceted
              and assertive personality in the industry.
